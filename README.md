# Stock Market Performance Analysis Dashboard

## üìä Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end data analysis of historical stock market data for major technology companies (AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, AMZN, TSLA) and the S&P 500 index (^GSPC). <br/>
The final output is a fully interactive dashboard built in Tableau that allows users to explore performance trends, volatility, and key trading indicators. <br/>
This repository contains the Python script for data acquisition, the advanced SQL query for data transformation, and a guide to reproducing the analysis and the dashboard.

## üöÄ Live Dashboard
A live, interactive version of the final dashboard is published on Tableau Public.<br/>

## ‚ú® Key Features
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Analyze data for a specific stock or compare multiple stocks simultaneously.  A date range slider allows for focused historical analysis.
- **Performance Trend Analysis**: Visualize daily adjusted closing prices against key technical indicators, including the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, to identify trends and potential trading signals (like the "Golden Cross").
- **Volatility Analysis**: A histogram of daily returns provides a clear view of each stock's volatility and risk profile.
- **Market Benchmarking**: Compare individual stock performance directly against the S&P 500 index to assess relative strength.
